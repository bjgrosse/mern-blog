# Sample MERN Project

This is a small sample project I did using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It's a simple public-blog interface that allows users to easily post and share content, including photos.

## Back end

Node.js with Express using Passport and JWT for the authentication.

## Front-end

The focus of this exercise was on creating a smooth user experience: clean user interface, low-friction interactions, smooth CSS transitions, mobile-responsive. Cloudinary is used for the image storage. We use image pre-fetching in the gallery view to eliminate load delay when swiping between images.

The design system is Material UI.
