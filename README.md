# Sample MERN Project

This is a small sample project I did using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It's a simple public-blog interface that allows users to easily post and share content publicly, including photos.

The focus of this exercise was on creating a smooth user experience: clean user interface, consistent interactions, smooth CSS transitions. The interface is fully mobile-friendly.
